# Project Rules

## Documentation and Code Structure
- Always add comprehensive documentation to functions, particularly after applying changes or fixes. Use Google-style docstrings.

## Error Handling
- For API endpoints, return a JSON object with an error message for non-successful responses, aligning with RESTful best practices.

## Commit Messages
- Use short and meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.

## Maintainability
- Write code that is highly maintainable for the long term, ensuring it does not cause more clutter or technical debt.
