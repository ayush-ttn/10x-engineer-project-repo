We are working on the project to deliver weekly tasks mentioned in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` to comply with the grading mentioned in `GRADING_RUBRIC.md`. We have defined some rule that you need to follow closely. The progress is tracked in `progress.md` so make sure you work on the basis of the progress. Analyse the next task for the week and explore related code and models to plan the change. DO NOT edit any code until I approve it.
Please start by summarizing:
1. The current task from `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` bases on `progress.md`.
2. Which files you plan to explore first.
